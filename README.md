# AIM404 - Contextual Bandits with Amazon SageMaker RL

This Notebook demonstrates how you can manage your own contextual multi-armed bandit workflow on SageMaker using the built-in Vowpal Wabbit (VW) container to train and deploy contextual bandit models. We show how to train these models that interact with a live environment (using a simulated client application) and continuously update the model with efficient exploration.

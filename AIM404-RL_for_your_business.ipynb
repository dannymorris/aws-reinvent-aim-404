    "We demonstrate how you can manage your own contextual multi-armed bandit workflow on SageMaker using the built-in [Vowpal Wabbit (VW)](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit) container to train and deploy contextual bandit models. We show how to train these models that interact with a live environment (using a simulated client application) and continuously update the model with efficient exploration.\n",

    "### Why Contextual Bandits?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever we look to personalize content for a user (content layout, ads, search, product recommendations, etc.), contextual bandits come in handy. Traditional personalization methods collect a training dataset, build a model and deploy it for generating recommendations. However, the training algorithm does not inform us on how to collect this dataset, especially in a production system where generating poor recommendations lead to loss of revenue. Contextual bandit algorithms help us collect this data in a strategic manner by trading off between exploiting known information and exploring recommendations which may yield higher benefits. The collected data is used to update the personalization model in an online manner. Therefore, contextual bandits help us train a personalization model while minimizing the impact of poor recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does this notebook contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the exploration-exploitation strategy, we need an iterative training and deployment system that: (1) recommends an action using the contextual bandit model based on user context, (2) captures the implicit feedback over time and (3) continuously trains the model with incremental interaction data. In this notebook, we show how to setup the infrastructure needed for such an iterative learning system. While the example demonstrates a bandits application, these continual learning systems are useful more generally in dynamic scenarios where models need to be continually updated to capture the recent trends in the data (e.g. tracking fraud behaviors based on detection mechanisms or tracking user interests over time). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical supervised learning setup, the model is trained with a SageMaker training job and it is hosted behind a SageMaker hosting endpoint. The client application calls the endpoint for inference and receives a response. In bandits, the client application also sends the reward (a score assigned to each recommendation generated by the model) back for subsequent model training. These rewards will be part of the dataset for the subsequent model training. "

The client application sends the recommended action to the user and stores the received reward in S3. The SageMaker hosted endpoint also stores inference data (state and action) in S3. The experiment manager joins the inference data with rewards as they become available. The joined data is used to update the model with a SageMaker training job.
